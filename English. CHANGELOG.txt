0. Changelog
---------------
v0.76- Corrected hash calcultion after RSV patching in games that had a lot of updates.
       Added RequiredSystemVersion cap when lowering it up, set as FW4.0 by default when
       it's auto-calculated, since it's needed for some newer updates.
       Linked RSV cap to the keygeneration selection. Now if you choose keygeneration 7
       RSV won't go lower than 6.2 even if real keygeneration is lower, if you choose 5
	   it won't go lower than FW5.0, etc...
v0.75- Added configuration from the bat, option to change keygeneration, corrected RSV
       readouts and more.
       1.- Added options to change keygeneration to help run games at lower firmwares.
           Note it won't always work as the game can have other dependencies than the 
           firmware. 6.2 to 6.0 seems to work and 6.2 to 5.0 works if basegame is 5.0
       2.- Added "Mode 0" - Profile configuration from the bat.
       3.- Added auto-profile linking. A profile Bat will link with it's configuration
           file if they follow the following name scheme:
           a) Bat -> batname.bat
           b) Profile in zconfig -> batname_options.cmd
           Where "batname" is a name of your choosing. You can add as many bats in the
           same folder as you want with different profiles this way.
       4.- Corrected RequiredSystemVersion reads. It seems like our update XML read the 
           value wrong and RSV is 4bytes long instead of 8bytes long.
           Thanks to Liam for the tip. ^_^
       5.- Added better navigation from the bat and dissable auto-exit in manual-mode so 
           people can see the log. (Auto-Exit can be activated in the configuration)
       6.- Added "mode 5: file-info mode". Dragg a file and choose if you want to:
           a) See it's content
           b) See "nut-info" (as NUT from blawar shows it)
           c) See Firmware Requirements and to what is patchable without changing the
              keygeneration )nca files encryption)
           d) Get a read of the cnmt
           You only need to load the file one time to get all reads and the functions
           will let you print each read to a text file in "INFO" folder at bat's route.
v0.70- Better RequiredSystemVersion patching, added Split Mode, added Update Mode
       1.- RequiredSystemVersion patching is now set by default in auto-mode.
       2.- Program asks before patching RequiredSystemVersion in manual mode
       3.- RequiredSystemVersion IS NOW PATCHED TO THE KEYGENERATION. This means the system
	   will ask you to download the system update if it's needed because it lacks the master-key.
       4.- ADDED SPLIT MODE as option 3 in manual mode. Split Mode will let you split multi-content
           xci or nsp to it's original content.
           Split mode is set to repack DLC and Updates always as nsp.
       5.- ADDED UPDATE MODE as option 4 in manual mode. This is a first and easy implementation.
           You first set the base, which needs to be a multi-content file then make a list of things 
           to update\upgrade the content.
           Choose if you want to strip UPDATES\DLC or both from the base file, choose how you want
           to repack the resulting content and if you want to patch the meta and the program will 
           process the file.
       NOTE: IF A XCI DOESN'T WORK WITH RSV PATCHING TRY TO REDO IT WITHOUT PATCHING AND TELL ME
       IN GITHUB. SOME OLDER GAMES SEEM TO HAVE ISSUES WITH THE META PATCHING IN XCI FORM. I STILL
       NEED TO CHECK THE REASON.
v0.65- Added option to patched RequiredSystemVersion in the meta nca (set by default)
       Changed Read\Write permissions for input files to Read
       Renamed "nut_RTR.py" to "squirrel" since it's deviating a lot from Nut's main line.
v0.62- Added option to just make zips in "Manual Mode. Individual processing.
v0.61- Mostly bugfixes.
	   1.- Changed counter functions from "find /C" to other method for people with inverted 
	       bar routes.
	   2.- Changed nca header check for xci extraction so it doesn't give issues in rev games.
	   3.- Fixed naming issues in individual modes. Basically extension getting in final name.
	   4.- Repacked again the dependencies bat since I forgot in last build.
	   5.- Added optional example profiles for nsp and xci.
	       1.- NSP: 
	        	auto-repack-> NSP
	                extract with deltas
			pack files in folders individually for auto mode
			work folder -> NSCB_ntemp
	       2.- XCI: 
	        	auto-repack-> XCI
	                extract without deltas
			pack files in folders authomatically for auto mode
			work folder -> NSCB_xtemp
		Just take the content of the profile you want or both of them and put them in the
		program root folder. Several profiles can be together.

v0.60- Support for delta skipping and direct extraction
	   1.- Added nut options. Copy function with or without deltas
		   It'll let you skip the deltas wich are not needed for xci files.
		   For nsp files they serve to transform old updates into new ones
		   so they install faster and old update doesn't stay in your system
		   They're dissabled by default if you use nsp consider activating them.
	   2.- Added direct extraction from xci files instead of using hactool so now
		   extraction speed is linked to buffer.
	   3.- Added a couple of fallbacks to detect masterkeyrev in non standard ticket
		   formats and old ticket formats.
	   4.- Minor code clean up and little fixes.

v0.50- Changed name to NSC_Builder (Nintendo Switch Cleaner and Builder)
	   1.- Added updated hacbuild.
	   2.- Removed nstool and nspBuild
	   3.- Added modifications for nut libraries
	   4.- Added multi-content building options for xci and nsp.
	   5.- Removed old assistant bat files and replaced them with XCI.bat and NSP.bat
	   6.- Changed options in option file.
	   7.- Ability to link options files editing NSCB.bat header
	   
v0.41- Solved some issues with v0.4 and made new options in the filenaming solution.
       1.- Added "nstool.exe by jakcron" to ztools folder to be able to read data from
       meta and control nca files.
       2.- Solve issues originated by spaces in the program route.
       3.- NEW OPTIONS ADDED TO "zconfig\nsp_cleaner_options.cmd"
       a.) OPTION 9: Process files by temporarly renaming them to a safe name
           * false->don't rename files
           * true->rename temporarly to safename
           * agro->"Agresive Output" rename temporarly to tempname and output as name 
             set in nacp file.
           -- DEFAULT OPTION IS "true" --
       NOTE: DLCS DON'T HAVE NACP FILE SO AGRO WILL OUTPUT THEM AS [titleid]
       b.) OPTION 10: Output final file as game real name looking at control nca
           (If option 9 is set as "agro" it will allways output as the real name)
           * false->output as original name/or original name corrected with safe characters
           * true-> output as "real" name, stored in control nca.
           * oinfo->"Only info"-> Use either original filename or safename and add only 
             titleid, version, content tag ...
           -- DEFAULT OPTION IS "oinfo" --
       NOTE: DLCS DON'T HAVE NACP FILE SO "true" IN THIS CASE WILL BE REPLACED BY THE "oinfo" OPTION

v0.40- While I finish NX_Builder I solved couple of naming issues.
       1.- Now you don't need [titleid] in filename.
       2.- Solved issues with special characters like !,+,&,$... Added correction for
       a bunch of them if you need to add more edit ztools/safename.bat
       Example: If you want to replace @ for a input:
       set fileinput=%fileinput:@=a%
       Or to delete it:
       set fileinput=%fileinput:@=%
       You'll probably see the first version for NX_Builder either trough the weekend
       or at the beginning of next week.
       NOTE: This version is using a function of my modified NUT libraries for NX_Builder
       so don't change the config to use the whole NUT.
v0.30- Added new options in zconfig.
       > Option 4: Way the items are organized.
         * line: scattered in output folder
         * folder: in folders according to game name
       > Option 5 and option 6: Output folders for xci and nsp. As default using
         a common folder for both.
       > Option 7: Preserve stripped files from the nsp as a .zip file for future
         restore function. (True by default)
       > Option 8: Replace original file with clean/converted files.As default false.
         TAKE CARE WITH THIS ONE. BETTER CHECK ALL WORKS FINE BEFORE ACTIVATING IT.
       Added option to erase list.txt in manual mode.
v0.21- Fixed issue with manual mode not detecting the user repacking input correctly
       Added better check for dlcs and updates, according to id
       Added another config parameter to "nsp_cleaner_options.cmd" (xnsp_ifnotgame)
       > This parameter serves to repack dlcs and updates as nsp if processing list as xci only.
         Options are:
         * true: repack dlcs and updates as nsp
         * false: skip dlc and update repacking when exporting as xci.
v0.2 - Added xci repacking. You can now repack as:
       *xci
       *nsp
       *both formats
     - Added nsp_cleaner_options.cmd at zconfig. It'll let you configure the repack
       option for auto-mode as (xci,nsp,both)
     - If xci repacking filenames with [UPD] tag are skipped
     - If with xci repacking an error is logged it activates a fallback and an
       xci + [lc].nsp are build.
     - Now we support subfolders, thanks to MadScript77 for the advice on how to 
       set it as in the other great advices he gave about the code.
     - For manual mode you can allways choose what format to build from the current
       list.
     - More changes coming soon.
v0.1 - First official release
